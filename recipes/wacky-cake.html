    <h2>Description</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"<em>Wacky cake</em>, also called <b>crazy cake</b>, <b>lazy cake</b>, <b>Joe cake</b>, <b>wowie cake</b>, and <b>WW II cake</b>, is a spongy, cocoa-based cake. It is unique in that unlike many pastries and desserts, no
            eggs, butter or milk are used to make the cake batter. <br>Active ingredients in wacky cake include flour,
            sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, vegetable oil, white vinegar, salt and vanilla extract. The eggless batter
            means that the structure of the cake is entirely supported by gluten, which is strengthened by the acidic
            vinegar and salt. Wacky cake is typically prepared by mixing dry ingredients in a baking pan and forming
            three hollows in the mixture, into which oil, vinegar, and vanilla are poured. Warm water is then poured
            over, and the ingredients mixed and baked."</p>
