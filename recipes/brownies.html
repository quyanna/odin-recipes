    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These rich, fudgy brownies are the ultimate indulgence—crispy on the
      edges, melt-in-your-mouth soft in the center, and packed with deep
      chocolate flavor. Each bite offers that perfect balance between gooey and
      chewy, with a glossy crackled top that hints at the decadence inside.
      Whether enjoyed warm from the oven or cooled to dense perfection, they’re
      a chocolate lover’s dream come true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Made with real melted chocolate and a touch of butter, these brownies have
      a luxurious texture that feels like a cross between a truffle and a cake.
      Optional add-ins like chocolate chips or walnuts add extra bursts of
      flavor and crunch, but even on their own, they’re dangerously good.
      Perfect with a cold glass of milk or a scoop of vanilla ice cream, they’re
      the kind of treat you’ll keep coming back to.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1&frac12; cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>&frac34; cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>&frac23; cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
      <li>&frac12; powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup dark chocolate chips</li>
      <li>&frac34; teaspoons sea salt</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325&deg;F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a
        9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it
        with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered
        sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and
        use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a
        toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better
        to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long).
        <b>Cool completely before slicing.</b> Store in an airtight container at
        room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!
      </li>
    </ol>
