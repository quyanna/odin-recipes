    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><em>Depression Cake</em> is the perfect dessert for when life gives you absolutely nothing, and you still feel
        the need to pretend things are fine. Born during the Great Depression, this culinary masterpiece was whipped up
        by people who had no butter, no milk, no eggs, and frankly, <b>no hope</b>—just an iron will and some baking soda. It’s
        the cake equivalent of putting on a nice outfit to cry on the couch.<br><br>
        Made from whatever was still in the pantry after the economy imploded: flour, sugar, vinegar, a splash of oil,
        and maybe a little cocoa if things weren’t too bleak, Depression Cake manages to be moist, slightly sweet, and
        emotionally hollow. It’s easy, affordable, and best of all, doesn’t require you to feel joy to make it. Great
        for when the stock market crashes, rent is due, or you’re simply out of eggs and the will to live.<br><br>

        Pairs beautifully with a hot cup of <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Boiled-Water" target="_blank"
