    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These Teriyaki Salmon Rice Bowls are a vibrant and satisfying meal that
      brings together tender chunks of pan-seared salmon with a rich, glossy
      teriyaki glaze. The salmon is lightly crisped on the outside while staying
      juicy and flaky inside, coated in a savory-sweet sauce made from soy
      sauce, honey, garlic, and ginger. Each bite is packed with umami and
      balanced flavor, making it a perfect protein to serve over fluffy white
      rice or your grain of choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      To round out the bowl, it's paired with a refreshing cucumber and avocado
      salad that adds coolness and creaminess to the dish. The crispness of the
      cucumber contrasts beautifully with the buttery texture of the avocado,
      bringing a fresh, light component that balances the rich salmon. Together,
      these elements create a well-rounded bowl thatâ€™s easy to put together on a
      weeknight but impressive enough to serve to guests.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the salmon into bite-sized cubes. In a mixing bowl, combine teriyaki
        sauce, olive or sesame oil, cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Whisk until
        smooth. Add salmon cubes into the bowl and gently mix until they're
        fully coated. Marinate for at least 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat your air fryer to 400&deg;F (200&deg;C). Place the salmon bites
        in a single layer in the air fryer basket, ensuring they aren't
        touching. You may need to cook them in batches. Cook for 7-10 minutes,
        turning them halfway, or until the salmon is cooked through and has a
        slightly crispy exterior.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine diced avocados, sliced cucumber, rice vinegar,
        sesame oil, salt, and pepper. Toss gently until everything is
        well-mixed. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sriracha sauce, lemon or lime
        juice, and salt. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve cooked rice on each plate, followed by a portion of the air-fried
        salmon bites. Add a scoop of avocado cucumber salad beside the salmon.
        Drizzle the sriracha mayo over the salmon or serve on the side. Garnish
        with black sesame seeds.
      </li>
    </ol>
